= Part 1: Project set up

In this first section, you will learn how to initialize a new project with the CLI toolbox that comes with *Enonic XP*. Then you will build and deploy the app with Gradle. Next you will create a couple of files for your first page component. Finally, youâ€™ll create a site with your app in the Content Studio.

== Initialize project

*Enonic XP* includes the http://docs.enonic.com/en/stable/reference/toolbox/index.html#toolbox[Toolbox CLI] which can perform several useful operations.
The http://docs.enonic.com/en/stable/reference/toolbox/init-project.html#init-project[init-project] operation will clone an existing project from a repository
source, such as https://github.com/[GitHub]. The https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/vanilla-starter[starter-vanilla] project will initialize a new application
with the standard structures required (see http://docs.enonic.com/en/stable/developer/projects/index.html#projects[Projects]).

. *Create a new folder* at a suitable location on your filesystem for the application project files. e.g. `/Users/<username>/projects/myapp`. This will be the project root.
. *Change directory* in the terminal to this project root.

 cd /Users/<username>/projects/myapp

. *Run the following command*, replacing `[$XP_INSTALL]` with the path to your unzipped XP installation:


 [$XP_INSTALL]/toolbox/toolbox.sh init-project -n com.company.myapp -r starter-vanilla -c v1.3.0

For example, if your XP installation is at `/Users/enonic/installs/enonic-xp-${release}` then you would enter:

 /Users/enonic/installs/enonic-xp-${release}/toolbox/toolbox.sh init-project -n com.company.myapp -r starter-vanilla -c v1.3.0

NOTE: Only basic characters (a-z, 0-9 and .) may be used for application names, and the name must be globally unique. We recommend following
  standard Java package naming conventions such as com.mycompany.myapp.

*Your project folder will now be filled with the standard folder structure for developing an app.*


== Build and Deploy

Now that the basic project structure is set up, we should test that it builds and deploys successfully. But before deploying the app, the
`$XP_HOME` environment variable must be set to the path of the home folder of the XP installation.

. *Run the following command* in the terminal, replacing `[$XP_INSTALL]` with your installation location (no brackets):

:: *Linux and OSX:*

  export XP_HOME=[$XP_INSTALL]/home

:: For example, if your XP installation is at `/Users/enonic/installs/enonic-xp-${release}` then you would enter:

  export XP_HOME=/Users/enonic/installs/enonic-xp-${release}/home

:: *Windows*:

  set XP_HOME=[$XP_INSTALL]/home

. *Execute the following command* (from the project root directory):

:: *Linux and OSX:*

  ./gradlew deploy

:: *Windows:*

  gradlew deploy

:: The included http://gradle.org>[Gradle wrapper] will build the app and then attempt to deploy it to your installation.

:: The deployment step simply moves the result of the build (the application JAR file) into the `$XP_HOME/deploy` directory.
From there, *Enonic XP* will detect, install and start the application automatically.

:: You will need to access the Administrative console to check that the app has installed and started. *Enonic XP* must be running to proceed.

. Log in to the http://localhost:8080[Administrative console] with the Administrative user credentials. (The default credentials are
userid: *su* and password: *password*).

. Navigate to the *Applications Tool*. The application you just deployed should be listed here.

. Click the app called "_Myapp_" to see information about it and confirm that it has started.

NOTE: You can change the display name of the application by editing the gradle.properties file.


== Create the "_Hello World_" Site

Our next goal is to set up a "_Hello World_" site in *Content Studio*, but first we must add some initial configuration to our project.

=== Site descriptor

An application can serve many purposes and building sites is just one of them. The `site.xml` file is the descriptor that will let *Enonic
XP* know that this app can be added to a site. Response filters and controller mappings can be set up in the site descriptor as well as
application configurations (see http://docs.enonic.com/en/stable/developer/site/site.html#site-descriptor[Site descriptors]).

A basic `site.xml` file was automatically created by the `init-project` script and we don't need to make any changes for now. Later in this
tutorial we will edit `site.xml` to add a site-wide configuration.

  [project-root]/src/main/resources/site/site.xml

=== Application description and icon

The `application.xml` file at `[project-root]/src/main/resources/application.xml` can be edited to provide a suitable description for
your app. Go ahead and give your app a custom description.

The `application.svg` file can be replaced with a custom app icon. The description and icon will be visible in the admin tools.

NOTE: Most of the files we will be working with are inside the "site" directory in the project folder - `src/main/resources/site. All file
  paths from now on will begin with `site/`.

=== Page Component

Page components are the most basic building blocks of websites in *Enonic XP* (see http://docs.enonic.com/en/stable/developer/site/page/index.html#page[Page]). They require a JavaScript
controller and optionally an XML descriptor and an HTML view. This first example does not need a descriptor file.

A page controller (see http://docs.enonic.com/en/stable/developer/site/page/index.html#page[Page]) is a JavaScript file that handles requests such as *GET* and *POST*.
Controllers usually pass data in the form of a JavaScript object to be dynamically rendered in an HTML view. No data is passed in the
example below, but the view file is specified and rendered as static HTML.

. Create a folder called `hello` inside the `site/pages` directory.

. Create the page controller and page view files specified below inside the `hello` folder:
+
[source,javascript]
----
include::../src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.js[]
----
+

The `view`  below is a simple HTML file. This file will be updated later to handle dynamic content.

+
[source,HTML]
----
include::../src/main/resources/site/pages/hello/hello.html[]
----
+

. Once these files are in place, redeploy the app from the terminal with `./gradlew deploy`.

NOTE: Each page controller must reside in its own folder under the `site/pages` directory. The name of the controller JavaScript file
  must be the same as the directory that contains it. The HTML view file can reside anywhere in the project and have any valid file name.
  This allows view files to be shared between components.

=== Create Site

Now that the files are in place, we can create the site in a browser using the Content Studio admin tool.
Switch between different tools by clicking the image:images/icon-menu.png[Menu icon, 30] menu icon (top right) to open the Launcher panel.

. In your browser, navigate to the *Content Studio* tool. (Use the menu icon at the top right)
. Click *New* and select *Site* from the list of content types (Opens a tab for editing the new site).
. Fill in the form with *Display Name*: _Hello World_.
. Select your *MyApp* application in the *Applications* dropdown.
. If you don't see a blue area on the right of the page then click image:images/icon-monitor.png[Menu icon, 30] button in the toolbar to open the *Page Editor*.
. Use the dropdown in the *Page Editor* (blue area) to select the "_hello_" page.
. Click the *Save draft* button in the toolbar (top-left).
. Now close the *Hello World* site editor tab to see the content pane.

When you click on the *Hello World* site content, the preview should look something like this:

****
This concludes part one of the tutorial.

*Let's review:*

You've learned how to initialize a new project with the CLI toolbox init-project.


Then you set the `$XP_HOME` environment variable and deployed the app with gradle.

Next, you created a page component with a JavaScript
controller and an HTML view file.

Finally, you created a site in the Content Studio and added the app and page component to the site.

This might seem like a lot of work just to make a static page; but we have laid a solid foundation in preparation for dynamically displaying
structured content in reusable components which you will learn about in the next section.
